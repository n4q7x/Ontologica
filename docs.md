## Why formal ontology? And if so, how?

### Background history on formal ontology

From ancient metaphysics to the birth of the internet.



Most applications are some sort of ontological data model. Data integration can usher in a new era of the web. We can envision a new paradigm called "ontological programming", and a "datanet" where people can share, link, publish, and attest (i.e. confirm validity of) data feeds. Companies can earn money publishing data feeds instead of developing apps.



Work in progress.
