Øhrstrøm, Schärfe & Uckelman 2008

In Jacob Lorhard’s Ontology: A 17th Century Hypertext on the Reality and Temporality of the World of Intelligibles (ICCS 2008, LNCS 5113), they say in the abstract that:

the term ontologia (‘ontology’) was used for the first time ever in Lorhard’s Ogdoas scholastica (1606).  ￼

They repeat the point in the introduction, explicitly saying Lorhard coined the term and “used this new term for the first time” in the 1606 Ogdoas.  ￼


Devaux & Lamanna 2009

Michaël Devaux & Marco Lamanna, “The Rise and Early History of the Term Ontology (1606–1730)”, Quaestio 9 (2009): 173–208, is the main history‑of‑philosophy piece.  ￼

They set out to list all known occurrences of ontologia from 1606 to 1730 and say explicitly that their list begins with Lorhard’s Ogdoas scholastica (1606) as the first occurrence of the term known today.  ￼

They also give the broader context (Ramism, Schulmetaphysik, etc.), which you can cite if you want to look serious about the intellectual background rather than just the lexeme.

This article has a DOI: 10.1484/J.QUAESTIO.1.100702.  ￼

Lamanna 2006 (the “first occurrence” note)

Before the 2009 big article, Marco Lamanna wrote a short piece specifically about this:

Marco Lamanna, “Sulla prima occorrenza del termine ‘Ontologia’. Una nota bibliografica”, Quaestio 6 (2006), 557–570.  ￼

That note is about the discovery and bibliographic status of the 1606 edition where Metaphysices, seu Ontologiae appears on the title page; it’s routinely cited as the turning point that pushed the “first occurrence” back from 1613 to 1606.  ￼

You don’t have to reproduce his whole argument; just citing it is enough to show you’re not making things up.

Barry Smith 2022

Barry Smith’s paper “The Birth of Ontology”, Journal of Knowledge Structures & Systems 3(1), 57–66 (2022), sums up where the scholarship landed.

The abstract says that Ogdoas scholastica (1606) “contains what is almost certainly the first published occurrence of the term ‘ontology’.”  ￼

Inside the paper he explicitly relies on Devaux & Lamanna and Lamanna’s 2006 note.  ￼

you can quote that phrase “almost certainly the first published occurrence” if you like; it’s well under the 25‑word copyright limit 


Øhrstrøm & Uckelman 2005/2007

Øhrstrøm and co. have another paper on the diagrammatical side of Lorhard’s ontology, which already treats Ogdoas scholastica (1606) as the key source.  ￼

It reinforces that (1) Lorhard’s work is firmly dated to 1606 and (2) metaphysica seu ontologia is the label for Book 8.

(f) Reference works that agree

These are “tertiary” but show the consensus:
	•	Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, entry on Johannes Clauberg: mentions that ontology appears “as a synonym for ‘metaphysics’ as early as Jacob Lorhard’s Ogdoas scholastica (1606)” and cites Devaux & Lamanna.  ￼
	•	Encyclopaedia Britannica, “Ontology”: says the Latin term ontologia was invented by Jacob Lorhard and first appeared in the 1606 Ogdoas scholastica.  ￼
	•	Wikipedia: Ontology (information science) also notes that the oldest extant record of the word is the Neo‑Latin ontologia in Lorhard’s 1606 work, and then in Goclenius’s 1613 Lexicon philosophicum.  ￼
	•	Various ontology/introduction texts now repeat that the term first appears in Ogdoas scholastica (1606).  ￼
