# Formal Ontology

By Julius Hamilton

## Introduction

### Why formal ontology? And if so, how?

In order to answer the question "Why formal ontology?", I will need to delve into what a formal ontology is. That concept can be decomposed in a simple way into two parts: "What is 'ontology'?", and, "What is 'formal'?".

#### A Short History of Ontology

> From ancient metaphysics to the birth of the internet.

callout box, tag?

The earliest known use of a word similar to "ontology" is in Jacob Lorhardt's Octet. [Citation]. This was in New Latin. It unknown where he got this word from, but that he studied under ____ and corresponded with people such as ____. 

On the title of his book, he uses it explicilty as a synonym for "metaphyiscs". Back then, what was metaphyiss? it was, the study of "what there is". in fact, lon gago, in aristotles time, there was physics, and there was metaphysics.

Thus, ontolgoy is peraps one of the most ufndmanteal disciplines that any human culture can come up iwth. in the broadest sense, it is, to borrow quine's phrasing, the analysis, study, quesitnoing, assertion, and questnog, of "what there is". most cultures, scouring thier cultural knoweldge of hte world, arguably have some kind of ontology impclit int hier cultures assertionsabout the world. the ancient vedas. chinese or taoist ontolgoh. this or that tribe, native americna, etc. 

a key thing to undesrtand is that ontology is both concrete things like, that god exist, say. paleo-ontology. but ontology is, lie metpahysics, a quesiton of "what ist he wrold made of"? it is about the highest categories there can be.

the word ontology became more awsocaited with systematic descriptons of all the kind sof concepts nad objects that exist in the world, thoruhg.... the .... early 1900s? foucault, quine, etc.

at some point (how?), it started to be used more in computer science and data modeling.

which takes u sto today: formal ontolgoy is on the rise. staisti sabout the use of the word. palantir, one of the world smost lucrative comapnies, is literally built on formal ontologies. that is the produc theu arem selling. etc.

#### a separate strand: computer science, flrmal methods, the mechainzation of reason.

again, our travels take us back to aristostle! the birth of logic. the algebraizatio of logic with machien in 1800s. boole, lovelace. leibniz. medieval lgoiicans. from early on, people have yearned for and sensed a connection between logic, reason, thought, language, etc. 



for me, large language models and knwledege graphs were 2 really improtnat things tha thelped me finaly realize about how knowledge could be formalized.

##### Shorter interlude on the notion of "formal"

This is less importnat, more like a footnote.

Most applications are some sort of ontological data model. Data integration can usher in a new era of the web. We can envision a new paradigm called "ontological programming", and a "datanet" where people can share, link, publish, and attest (i.e. confirm validity of) data feeds. Companies can earn money publishing data feeds instead of developing apps.



Work in progress.


note how there are almost no good fully open source eontology tools. like graphdb, ontotext. all for enterise. "formal ontology for th emasses" becuas we are makign tmainstream. the smeanti web is for scienctist, it also faile do bridge the gpa.



Like, taskwarrior: that is an ontology. but the ontolgoy is flawed. our tools do not conforfm to the semantic strucutres in our mind. empahisze that.

connect to llms as backend for ontological rag.

or llm tool use.





other parts like, about logic, about rdf, et.


"manifesto.json" - manifesto




a data labeling tool for people to contributing ot building a massive pool of facts.




why fomral ontology:

- precisely structured thinking
- - sematnic gauging: what do words even mean?




applicaitons
open source intelligence
journalism
social science, like testing asseritons, querying the world in natural language
building uoru own knwoeldge base
doing resarch, 
job huting - finding the jobs
all knid of data integraionts projects, job postings
formaliziaotn of law, like data privacy documents
designing new appps, like a chess playing gmae
much easier to implant teh same info for llm conversaionts, context
sving your resume info in a persoan lontolgoy alows you to regenreate your resume in different formats, modify one msall piec eof info, etc. or "slice", just take some parts of the ontology dpeneixng on the job.
