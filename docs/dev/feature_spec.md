## What does it do?

The most essential features intended to be supported (many of which currently are) are:

- adding new records into an ontology
- deleting records from an ontology
- reverting changes
- modifying or editing records
- enumerating new entries
- classifying entries
- querying records
- automatic inference
- functions which check how complete your ontology is
- a logic engine which infers / generates the theory of your ontology
- a comfortable GUI and CLI tool
- ease for switching back and forth between different ontology files, syncing in the cloud, and critically, merging or splitting and refactoring ontologies into separate files


That's basically the "stage 0" roadmap, which I'm working on right now.


Ontologica supports:

- Adding Things & Predicates  
- Binding new Statements  
- Enumerating all possible statements over existing Things × Predicates × Things  
- Pretty-printing (recursively formatted block output)  
- Slicing by subject/predicate/object using label, id, or Thing  
- Flexible searching  
- Pickle save/load  
- JSON export/import  
- A working CLI for everyday use
