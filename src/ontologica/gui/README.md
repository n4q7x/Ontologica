# Ontologica GUI & Labeling Tool

A key aspect of the GUI will not just be a visual editor, but a very useful labeling application for going through tons of statements/data points that need to be human-labeled for these massive semantic ontologies.

- The GUI will include a power labeling tool.
- These will be two separate tools:
  - The GUI will be more lightweight and focused on ontology visualization and editing.
  - The labeling tool will be more heavy-duty, suitable even for enterprise use and large-scale annotation workflows.
