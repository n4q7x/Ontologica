# About

Ontologica is a formal ontology tool. It is a work in progress. It is by Julius Hamilton. It is programmed in Python. 

# Background

My interest in knowledge graphs and formal ontologies took hold in 2023 with the advent of user-facing large language models (namely, ChatGPT). Though I was interested in computer programming, philosophy, linguistics, semantic precision, rigorous analysis, logical reasoning, the formalization of meaning, and the automation of natural language related-processes before that, there was something about LLMs that really captured my imagination and set me on a research journey to try to think about how we could use deterministic computer programs to draw logical inferences based on conceptual models of reality. I realized that I needed to understand the foundations of mathematics and logic much better, so I have been studying those for the past 3 years.

# Uses

Formal ontologies can be used for:

- recording information
- retrieving information
- checking for logical consistency
- automating processes
- discovering new things


# Features
- create ontologies
- delete ontologies
- edit ontologies
- add records to ontologies
- delete records from ontologies
- modify records in ontologies
- run functions over ontologies
- export data
- import data

# Design

Ontologica aims to set a new standard for the usability of formal ontology tools.

# Prototypes

The following are envisioned examples of what it would be like to use Ontologica. These examples will then be implemented in code.

## Example 1: Create an Ontology from scratch

```python

import ontology

my_ontology = ontology.Ontology()

```

# To Do

- refactor repo heavily

# Conceptual Foundation
