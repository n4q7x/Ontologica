<h3>Definition</h3>

"<strong>Ontologica</strong>" refers to:

<ol>
  <li>A philosophical stance.</li>
  <li>A formal structure.</li>
  <li>A software application.</li>
</ol>

</div>



<h2>Introduction</h2>

When working with <strong>Ontologica</strong>, you should assume the following.</p>





  <h3>1. There are things.</h3>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <p>Depending on who you ask, this is either:</p>

  <ol>
    
    
    <li>too trivial to require commentary;</li>
    <li>or true but a necessary axiomatic assertion;</li>
    <li>or full of ambiguity, paradox and confusion;</li>
    <li>or perhaps even false.</li>
    
    
    </ol>
    
    Nonetheless, it is the first and most important assertion in the theory of this ontology: "<em>The world is made of things. Every thing is a thing. Anything that can be talked about is a thing. There is nothing that is not a thing.</em>"</p>

  <p>'Thing' is the all-encompassing category. It should not be understood in a more restricted sense like "inanimate object", "physical object", or "concrete entity". 'Thing' does not impose qualitative constraints on what a thing can be like. It can even be used to talk about poor and vaguely defined things, things which we aren't even sure what they are, or if they exist.</p>
    
  <p>In the sense of model theory, 'Thing' is our domain of discourse.</p>

This is not at all to say that these statements are <em>self-evident</em>. Far from it. They are not self-evident, primarily, because it is not totally clear what they mean. One reason it is not so clear what they mean, is because it is not clear (to me) what the word "mean" means. Yet, we make use of them for a few alternative reasons:

- they are <em>hard to deny</em>
(elaboarte on that)

- they are a minimum / modicum of (ontological) commitment


(- it doesn tmater because our onotlogy grows and coherentizes itself, so,m we can always go back and revise past stataemtns)


  these statemenst are not necessarily self evident nor free from ambigutiy. i..e, (talk about differne interpretaions).

  on the other hand, they are extremely rudiemntary and simple.

  we can even genreat snetnces with formal grammars.

  history of theories of meaning: equivalence classes of sentences.

  <h4>2. There are things about things.</h4>
This notion has also been called "predicates" or "relations". Its essence is the observation that, for some given thing, one can ask something about that thing. For example, given a car, I can ask, "What is its color?", or, "Who are its friends?" A thing about a spoon is its size. A thing about the concept of democracy is its definition.

  There will be some more dialectical puzzles to work out, regarding predicates. Some things I have been considering:

  <ul>


    <li>When we ask, "What is a thing about cars?", why does it seem we can answer that question either talking about the values it takes under certain predicates, versus the predicates which are defined for it?</li>
    <li>What if we collapsed the distinction between things and predicates and used a single universal binary operation where any Thing can act in the predicate role? Would it be illuminating or be poorly defined?</li>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>

  Anyway, for now, we are assuming there is a kind of extra-linguistic, mathematical operation which, unfortunately, we simply cannot question (at least not yet). We can choose to take a predicate, a thing, and a thing, and consider them as a little "unit" - a Cartesian triple. It is important to reflect on the properties of such a "triple". Mathmatically, it is a composite object: it can be talked about as a single thing, yet we can also reach inside and grab the internal things it is made of (its subject, predicate, and object).

  For the time being, we basically just assume that mathematical idea I just stated.

  <strong>These are the two most important ideas in the foundations of Ontologica.</strong>
  
Unlike in some other formal conceptions of the world, in Ontologica, <strong>a predicate is also a thing</strong>. At the risk of becoming redundant, I may frequently invoke the dictum that "every thing is a thing", as a reminder of this principle.

The rest of the theory I am still working on, so the following is a bit more tentative.

  There will probably be a fundamental notion I introduce called an <strong>action</strong>.

  Conventionally, it is a well-established idea that you can take a predicate and "apply" it to some atomic entity, to form some unit of meaning, like, "likesPickles()" applied to a certain person, "Jimmy", formed a statement analogous to saying "Jimmy likes Pickles".

  My current issue is that I believe there are multiple ways to compose such elements into some new element, so I want to be very careful in how I define this.

  <h4>Interlude on Functions and Acts of Creation</h4>

  We should think about the idea of "taking a subject, a predicate, and an object, and creating a statement from them" very carefully.

  The abstract conception of an ontology, in Ontologica, is more or less using set theory. Your ontology consists of some collection of things. However, your ontology exists in time - like you do. When I ask (myself, or someone else), "Is so-and-so in my ontology?", the question is with regards to what is in my ontology <em>right now</em>.

  Ontologies are meant to be changed. We change them by adding new entries to them. Sometimes we might want to remove entires, or modify some of the ones we added. But abstractly, despite that the ontology is meant to carry so much complex meaning, in a way, we can reduce all questions about the ontology to questions of <em>existence</em>. To ask, "Does Jim like peaches?" with regards to the ontology is more literally to ask, "Does the fact "Jim likes peaches" <em>exist in this ontology (right now)</em>?"

  


  Work in progress, to be continued soon.



assertions vs observations
  

  lets consoldiate what weve asserted so far:

  (the motto, lists of sentneces)

  there are things
  there are things about things
  there are knds of things
  thing about a thing is akindof thing
  having as kind has as kind thing about A thing


  etc


  show how man languages it can be tranlsated into, i.e. most langauges have some words like htis

  the notion of "reference", i wanted to use a bianry opeation, but it didnt work. i.e. "as to perosn, the netit name is..


  perahps we can surmise a primitive ontolgoical framework cross cutrlaly, idk



  i.e. mention how some philsophers have no clue what is outside the human mind


  but if there were not things, even then, the world wou ldhave to be made of htings at the bototm,w ouudl it not? even if not physicla things, i.e. subaotmic partiles, then its math. eevn if its quantum.a t some point, it becomes impossible to say that there are in fact not things.
  




  linguistic normalizioant of verbs. every sentence in this document about ontolgoic acan be conveted to a triple by an ai, but we estbalished like a style guide in that verbs should be changed to their subjunctve, not declaratvei form.




  List of statements, like, ontology genreation form.
  
  Ontologica is based on the idea that there are "things".
Ontologica is (etc.)
