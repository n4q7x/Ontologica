  <h3>Conceptual Foundation</h3>

  <p>
In order to understand how to build ontologies in Ontologica, it is necessary to understand how Ontologica portrays the world to be. Whether or not you agree with the following statements, when using Ontologica, you can try to assume they are true, and think about how to represent whatever it is you want to describe or model in this way.

  <h4>There are things.</h4>

  This is either too trivial to require commentary, or full of ambiguity, paradox and confusion, or true but a necessary axiomatic assertion, or perhaps even false; depending on who you ask. Nonetheless, it is the first, most important assertion in understanding this ontology. The world is made of things. Everything is a thing. Anything that can be talked about is a thing. There is nothing that is not a thing.

  <h4>There are things about things.</h4>
This notion has also been called "predicates" or "relations". Its essence is the observation that, for some given thing, one can ask something about that thing. For example, given a car, I can ask, "What is its color?", or, "Who are its friends?" A thing about a spoon is its size. A thing about the concept of democracy is its definition.
