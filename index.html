  <h3>Conceptual Foundation</h3>

  <p>
In order to understand how to build ontologies in Ontologica, it is necessary to understand how Ontologica portrays the world to be. Whether or not you agree with the following statements, when using Ontologica, you can try to assume they are true, and think about how to represent whatever it is you want to describe or model in this way.
  </p>

  <h4>There are things.</h4>

  This is either too trivial to require commentary, or full of ambiguity, paradox and confusion, or true but a necessary axiomatic assertion, or perhaps even false; depending on who you ask. Nonetheless, it is the first, most important assertion in understanding this ontology. The world is made of things. Everything is a thing. Anything that can be talked about is a thing. There is nothing that is not a thing.

  <h4>There are things about things.</h4>
This notion has also been called "predicates" or "relations". Its essence is the observation that, for some given thing, one can ask something about that thing. For example, given a car, I can ask, "What is its color?", or, "Who are its friends?" A thing about a spoon is its size. A thing about the concept of democracy is its definition.

  <strong>These are the two most important ideas in the foundations of Ontologica.</strong>
  
Unlike in some other formal conceptions of the world, in Ontologica, <strong>a predicate is also a thing</strong>. At the risk of becoming redundant, I may frequently invoke the dictum that "every thing is a thing", as a reminder of this principle.

The rest of the theory I am still working on, so the following is a bit more tentative.

  There will probably be a fundamental notion I introduce called an <strong>action</strong>.

  Conventionally, it is a well-established idea that you can take a predicate and "apply" it to some atomic entity, to form some unit of meaning, like, "likesPickles()" applied to a certain person, "Jimmy", formed a statement analogous to saying "Jimmy likes Pickles".

  My current issue is that I believe there are multiple ways to compose such elements into some new element, so I want to be very careful in how I define this.

  <h4>Interlude on Functions and Acts of Creation</h4>

  We should think about the idea of "taking a subject, a predicate, and an object, and creating a statement from them" very carefully.

  The abstract conception of an ontology, in Ontologica, is more or less using set theory. Your ontology consists of some collection of things. However, your ontology exists in time - like you do. When I ask (myself, or someone else), "Is so-and-so in my ontology?", the question is with regards to what is in my ontology <em>right now</em>.

  Ontologies are meant to be changed. We change them by adding new entries to them. Sometimes we might want to remove entires, or modify some of the ones we added. But abstractly, despite that the ontology is meant to carry so much complex meaning, in a way, we can reduce all questions about the ontology to questions of <em>existence</em>. To ask, "Does Jim like peaches?" with regards to the ontology is more literally to ask, "Does the fact "Jim likes peaches" <em>exist in this ontology (right now)</em>?"
